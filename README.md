# Problem Statement üîç

Coin Warden is the culmination of our shared inspiration and determination to bridge the knowledge gap in the rapidly evolving world of Web3 and blockchain technology. As avid tech enthusiasts, we were driven by the idea of democratizing access to quality Web3 education. Our motivation stemmed from a glaring void in the ed tech space ‚Äì the absence of a comprehensive app catering specifically to Web3.


# Inspiration üïπ

The inspiration behind Coin Warden was born from our fascination with blockchain and its transformative potential. We recognized that while the world was rapidly embracing this technology, educational resources to understand and leverage it effectively were scarce. This realization sparked our ambition to create a platform that would empower individuals from all backgrounds to delve into the exciting world of Web3, from beginners to advanced users.

# Challenges Faced üî¨

Participating in our first hackathon presented a series of unexpected challenges. Each obstacle forced us to think creatively and problem-solve efficiently.
Venturing into the blockchain realm introduced us to a unique set of complexities. Integrating two intricate domains, app development and blockchain, required us to gain an in-depth understanding of both areas. Despite these challenges, our determination and commitment to our project remained unwavering.

In conclusion, Coin Warden embodies not only our dedication to Web3 education but also our unwavering commitment to continuous learning and growth. It is a testament to the power of inspiration and collaboration in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
